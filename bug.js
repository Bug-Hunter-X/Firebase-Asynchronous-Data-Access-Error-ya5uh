The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has been fully populated. This can happen if you're trying to access data within a listener callback before the data has been loaded. For instance, if your listener callback tries to read a property that hasn't been fully downloaded yet, you might encounter unexpected behavior or errors. This commonly occurs when working with asynchronous operations and data fetching from Firebase.
