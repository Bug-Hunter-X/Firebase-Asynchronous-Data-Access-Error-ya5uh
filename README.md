This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase when working with asynchronous data fetching. The bug involves accessing properties of a document snapshot before the snapshot is fully populated, causing unexpected behavior or errors.  The solution provides a proper method of handling asynchronous operations and data fetching using promises or async/await. This ensures that the data is fully loaded before attempting to access its properties.
